        <p><b>Eric Zhan</b> &#183; Competitive Math, Physics, Chemistry</p>
        <p>
          Hi. I‚Äôm Eric Zhan and a freshman at Mountain View High School enthusiastic about math,
          science, and music. I won regional Mathcounts twice, received 7th in the state at 6th
          grade, 6th place in 7th grade, and won state and qualified for nationals on behalf of
          Washington State at 8th grade. I scored a perfect 25/25 twice on the AMC 8, on the
          Distinguished Honor Roll for the AMC 10, and qualified for AIME every year since 6th
          grade. I‚Äôm now working towards qualifying for USAJMO/MOP math camp. Starting in middle
          school, I took AP Calculus AB, BC, and AP Chemistry at MVHS (scoring 5s on all). I‚Äôm now
          taking Multivariable Calculus, AP Physics 1, and AP Biology. I‚Äôm on the MVHS science bowl
          team one, and was on the middle school Science Bowl 1st team, winning top 3 in the PNW
          region twice and the All-Star award in 8th grade. I play cello in the MVHS Chamber
          Orchestra while being a pianist with ABRSM performance (grade 8) and music theory (grade
          5). I‚Äôm also a competitive swimmer. I am glad to have a chance to offer my help!
