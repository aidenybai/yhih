          Hi! My name is Spencer Chang, and I'll be a junior at Mountain View High School this fall.
          As an active member of clubs such as NHS, robotics, etc. I have also pursued the path of
          STEM intensively, having taken most of the AP STEM classes, including both computer
          science and math AP's. This idea began as a small virtual class of 4 kids and a young
          teen(yours truly) with a passion for outreach when school suddenly shut down; inspired to
          go even further beyond, despite our initial struggles, I'm really grateful to have such
          amazing friends who all aimed to build up this project, as well as all the support that I
          got from my friends, family, teachers and peers! This is our first time doing this, so it
          might not be complete yet, but I do hope that this can become something permanent!
        </p>
