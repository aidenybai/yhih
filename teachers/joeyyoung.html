          I am Joey Young and I will be a junior next year attending Mountain View High School. I
          enjoy many STEM subjects and have been drawn to them since I was very young. In high
          school, I scored 5's on AP Calculus AB and BC, Biology, and Chemistry. I have also self
          studied the AP Physics 1 course and am currently taking AP Physics C. I have participated
          in several high school clubs and activities, including the MVHS Chamber Orchestra, Red
          Cross, Key Club, Science Olympiad, National Honor Society, and Robotics. Outside of
          school, I enjoy practicing viola, which I have been playing since 5th grade, and playing
          strategy video games.
