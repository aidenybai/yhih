          Hi! My name is Susan and I'm a sophomore at Mountain View High School. I've taken a
          handful of AP courses, including AP Calculus and AP Biology, and am passionate about
          reading and writing as well as music, having played piano for 11 years. At school, I'm
          involved in volunteer organizations, such as Key Club, and academic clubs, like Science
          Olympiad. I know first-hand how difficult learning new material on your own can be, so I'm
          more than ready to offer a hand if you need it. I hope to help you truly understand the
          concepts and ideas you encounter in your study, beyond simply memorizing rules or plugging
          in formulas. Can't wait to get started!
