        <p><b>Timothy Tso</b> &#183; Math, Physics, CS(Python, JS), Web dev</p>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Timothy Tso, a junior at Mountain View High School. I've taken multiple
          AP math courses, including Calculus AB and BC, scoring 5 on the AP tests. I have also
          taken AP Physics 1 and am currently taking AP Physics C. Other than this, I have done
          coding since the beginning of middle school, becoming proficient in many programming
          languages like Python and Rust. I also have experience with website development, including
          HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Outside of academics, I enjoy watching movies and playing video
          games.
