          Hi! My name is Sunny Wang and I will be a junior next year at Camas High School. I have
          pursued mathematics extensively since elementary school, particularly in a competitive
          setting. I have a fair amount of experience, qualifying for the AIME three times and
          receiving first place at regional Mathcounts. Aside from math, I serve as a mentor in a
          club called Youth Research Scholars, where I work with students at Shahala and Skyridge to
          develop research projects. I've also been playing piano competitively for twelve years,
          and have won numerous young artist competitions and scholarships, including being the MTNA
          state alternate. I also participate in NHS, Science Olympiad, Physics Olympiad, Math Club,
          Knowledge Bowl, and varsity tennis. I‚Äôm glad to have this opportunity to share my
          knowledge with others and I look forward to working with you!
        </p>
